## Formula Used
### Monthly Payment:
\[
M = \frac{P \cdot r}{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}
\]
Where:
- \( M \): Monthly payment
- \( P \): Loan amount (principal)
- \( r \): Monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12 and converted to decimal)
- \( n \): Total number of payments (loan term in months)

### Total Repayment:
\[
\text{Total Repayment} = M \cdot n
\]

### Total Interest:
\[
\text{Total Interest} = \text{Total Repayment} - P
\]
